        <p>
            Leonid Petrov works in integrable probability, an area of
            mathematical research at the interface between probability /
            statistical physics on the one hand and representation
            theory/quantum integrability on the other. He applies tools from
            integrability (symmetric functions and Yang-Baxter equations for
            solvable lattice models) to analyze the asymptotic behavior of
            stochastic models motivated by a wide range of real-world questions,
            including the structure of ice and other condensed matter,
            magnetism, quantum spin systems, thermodynamics, traffic models, and
            directed polymers.

            Petrov completed his Ph.D. in 2010 in Moscow with advisor Grigori
            Olshanski. Following a postdoctoral position at Northeastern
            University (2011-2014), he joined the University of Virginia as
            faculty in Department of Mathematics. He has held visiting positions
            at MIT (2017-2018), MSRI (Fall 2021), and IPAM (Spring 2024).
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, he is also involved in broadening access to AI tools for
            working mathematicians by

            and participating in panel discussions. He also serves as an AI
            guide for Department of Mathematics, University of Virginia.
