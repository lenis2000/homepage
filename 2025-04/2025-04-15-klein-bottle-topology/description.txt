The Topology of Klein Bottles
Initial exploration of the properties of Klein bottles as non-orientable surfaces. This note examines the basic topological properties, construction methods, and visualization techniques for understanding these fascinating objects.

Key topics include:
- Basic definition and construction
- Embedding in 4-dimensional space
- Relationship to MÃ¶bius strips
- Homeomorphism and homotopy properties
- Classic jokes about topologists (they can't tell their coffee mug from their donut)
