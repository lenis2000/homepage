Breakthrough on the Collatz Conjecture
This note contains preliminary work on a potential approach to proving the Collatz conjecture using techniques from dynamical systems and non-standard analysis. While not a complete proof, it identifies a promising pathway involving ergodic theory.

Key insights include:
- A new recurrence relation that models the Collatz sequence as a Markov process
- Application of transfer operators to the problem
- Connections to Syracuse random walks
- A potential invariant measure that could lead to a full proof
- Limitations of current computational verification approaches
