Why Mathematicians Can't Find Things in Hilbert Space
A humorous exploration of why objects in infinite-dimensional spaces are so difficult to locate. This note examines the topological properties of Hilbert spaces through the lens of the classic "I can't find my keys" problem, reimagined for functional analysis.

Key concepts include:
- The weak topology vs. strong topology joke
- Why compact operators are the "responsible roommates" of Hilbert space
- How orthonormal bases are like terrible filing systems
- The unbounded operator as the quintessential absent-minded professor
