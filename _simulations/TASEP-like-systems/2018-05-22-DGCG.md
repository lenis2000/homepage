### The model [1]

The model depends on two parameters $\beta>0$ and $-\beta\le \nu<1$.
The evolution of a height function $H_T(N)$ is as follows.
At each discrete time step, add a box 
to a place where we can with probability $\beta/(1+\beta)$.
If a box is added, simultaneously add a random number of boxes
according to a truncated geometric random variable with 
parameter $(\nu+1)/(\beta+1)$, i.e., such that 
if an overhang occurs, we truncate the resulting added boxes.
The special case $\nu=-\beta$ reduces the model to the classical 
geometric corner growth whose fluctuations were studied in 
[2].

The next picture indicates one possible time step in DGCG (doubly geometric corner growth).

### Sampling algorithm

The simulation is a simple forward
sampling of the discrete time Markov chain.

### Data file format

There is no data for this simulation.
The simulation pictures are shown in "Russian notation", i.e., rotated
by 45 degrees. 
The random height function is given in blue, and 
there is also a theoretical limit shape
(a cubic curve) obtained in [1] superimposed onto it.
