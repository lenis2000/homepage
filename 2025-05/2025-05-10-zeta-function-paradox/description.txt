The Paradoxical Values of the Riemann Zeta Function
An exploration of counterintuitive values of the Riemann zeta function, focusing on the famous result that 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12. This note investigates how regularization methods in physics and mathematics lead to these bizarre but useful results.

Topics covered:
- Analytic continuation of the zeta function 
- Applications in string theory and quantum field theory
- Ramanujan summation techniques
- The connection to the Casimir effect
- Humorous dialogue between Euler and a modern physicist
