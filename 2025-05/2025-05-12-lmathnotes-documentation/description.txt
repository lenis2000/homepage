LMathNotes - Hugo-based Mathematical Research Notes Repository

LMathNotes is a specialized Hugo-based web application designed for organizing, displaying, and navigating mathematical research notes with a focus on LaTeX content. It provides a comprehensive system for managing academic notes with advanced features for confidentiality, history tracking, and content exploration.

## Features

### Content Organization
- Chronological organization of notes in dated directories
- Specialized handling for LaTeX/TeX files with custom viewer
- Support for both standard research notes and handwritten notebook collections
- Full-text search across all note content, titles, and descriptions

### Navigation & Display
- **Homepage View**: Chronological listing of all notes with expandable descriptions
- **Monthly Notes View**: Notes organized by month with consistent display
- **Handwritten Notebooks View**: Special display for handwritten notebook collections
- **History View**: Chain visualization connecting related notes via prev.txt references
- **TeX Viewer**: Specialized viewer for LaTeX files with syntax highlighting

### Specialized Features

#### TeX File Handling
- Custom TeX viewer with syntax highlighting via Prism.js
- Line numbers for easy reference
- Soft wrap toggle for improved readability
- Automatic preamble separation with collapsible display
- One-click download option
- File metadata display (size, path)

#### Search Capabilities
- Real-time searching across all content
- Case-smart search (uppercase for exact matches, lowercase for case-insensitive)
- Visual feedback with dynamic filtering of results
- Keyboard shortcut support (Escape to clear/focus)
- "No results" messaging with clear user feedback

#### History Tracking
- Visualization of note evolution through connected history chains
- Bidirectional navigation between related notes
- Recursive history display with circular reference detection
- Client-side JavaScript for dynamic history exploration

#### Confidential Content Protection
- Confidential notes marked via `conf.txt` files
- Content protection with CSS blur effect
- Universal keyboard shortcut (Cmd+B / Ctrl+B) to toggle blur state
- Consistent protection across all views (main, monthly, handwritten, history)
- Selection prevention for blurred content

### Technical Details
- Built on Hugo static site generator
- Custom templates for specialized content types
- Local storage for preserving UI state (open/closed sections)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Custom CSS for distinct styling of different content types

## File Types & Conventions

The system uses several special files to manage content and relationships:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `description.txt` | Defines note title (first line) and description (remaining text) |
| `prev.txt` | Lists note IDs that precede the current note in history |
| `conf.txt` | Marks a note as confidential (triggering blur effect) |
| `*.tex` | LaTeX source files (rendered in custom viewer) |
| `*.pdf` | Compiled PDF documents (available for direct viewing/download) |

Note ID refers to the directory name of a note (e.g., `2025-05-11-blur-test-1`). These IDs are used in `prev.txt` files to establish relationships between notes and in URL parameters for the history view.

## Directory Structure

```
- content/
  - YYYY-MM/
    - YYYY-MM-DD-Note-Title/
      - YYYY-MM-DD-Note-Title.tex  (Main TeX file)
      - YYYY-MM-DD-Note-Title.pdf  (Compiled PDF)
      - description.txt            (Title and description)
      - prev.txt                   (Historical connections)
      - conf.txt                   (Optional, for confidential notes)
      - additional files...        (Images, bibliographies, etc.)
  - Handwritten_Notebooks/
    - YYYY-MM-NN_Notebook_description/
      - description.txt
      - PDF files...
- layouts/
  - Custom templates for different views
- static/
  - css/
  - js/
  - icons/
```

## URL Structure

| URL Pattern | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `/` | Homepage with chronological listing of all notes |
| `/YYYY-MM/` | Monthly note listing |
| `/Handwritten_Notebooks/` | Handwritten notebooks listing |
| `/history?note=YYYY-MM-DD-Note-Title` | History view for specific note |
| `/tex-viewer?path=content/path/to/file.tex` | TeX file viewer |

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Hugo (extended version recommended)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `hugo server` to start the development server
4. Access the site at `http://localhost:1313/`

For production deployment:
1. Run `hugo` to build the static site
2. Deploy the `public` directory to your web server

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `hugo.toml`:

- Custom media types for TeX files
- Server headers for correct content type handling
- Module mounts for serving content directory as static files
- Theme configuration for Paperesque base theme

## Usage Guidelines

### Adding New Notes
1. Create a new directory with the naming pattern `YYYY-MM-DD-Note-Title`
2. Add your main TeX file with matching name
3. Create a `description.txt` with title and description
4. (Optional) Add `prev.txt` to link to previous related notes
5. (Optional) Add `conf.txt` if the note contains confidential information

### Navigation
- Use the main page for chronological browsing
- Use search for finding specific content
- Use history view to track research evolution

### Working with Confidential Content
- Add an empty `conf.txt` file to any note directory to mark as confidential
- Use Cmd+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows/Linux) to toggle blur effect
- Content remains protected until explicitly revealed by the user
