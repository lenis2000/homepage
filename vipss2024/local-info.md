<ul>
    <li><b>I</b>. The classroom for the summer school will be in the main part of the University of Virginia Grounds.</li>
    <li><b>II</b>. UVA Corner has many lunch and dinner options. Along West Main St., there are many hotels which are in walking distance from the University (though they may be on the expensive side).</li>
    <li><b>III</b>. This intersection has many less expensive hotels, and is accessible by Uber or a short drive.</li>
    <li><b>IV</b>. UVA Downtown Mall offers high-end dining options.</li>
    <li><b>V</b>. If you'll be at a place in driving distance, then one of the most reasonable parking places (a combination of cost/distance) is Culbreth Garage, which is a 10-minute walk from the classroom.</li>

<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2.5 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. The local airport code is <b>CHO</b>, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town (it is about 20 minutes/USD25 on Uber from the town). Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (<b>RIC</b>). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (<b>IAD</b>) and Washington Reagan (<b>DCA</b>). Flying to <b>CHO</b> would probably require a connection and may be less convenient, depending on where you are flying from.
<br><br>

<p>Random things to consider from far airports:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unfortunately, almost no direct public transportation or shuttles exist between RIC and Charlottesville. From IAD and especially DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a possible option. However, Amtrak runs only a few trains between Washington and Charlottesville per day.</li>
    <li>From/to IAD, Manassas Amtrak station is about a 30-minute taxi/uber ride. Again, there are only a few trains per day.</li>
    <li>There exists Megabus service between IAD and Charlottesville downtown. See <a href="https://us.megabus.com/route-guides/charlottesville-to-dulles-washington-airport-iad-bus">here</a></li>
    <li>One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the school, having a car is not necessary - the University and the town are walkable.</li>
    <li>Driving from RIC to Charlottesville is about 1h15min, and the drive is more pleasant than from Washington.</li>
    <li>To/from IAD, Uber costs up to USD200 one way, so a car rental is less expensive (your University likely has a special discount on car rentals).</li>
</ul>
