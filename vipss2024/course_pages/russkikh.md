# Dimers and Embeddings

**Abstract**: Dimer model is a probability measure on perfect matchings of a graph. We present several tools to study the dimer model on planar bipartite graphs: Kasteleyn's theory, combinatorial correspondences with other models, discrete complex analysis, and embeddings of planar graphs.
