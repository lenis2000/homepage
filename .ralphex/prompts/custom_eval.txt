# custom evaluation prompt for visual review output
# evaluates the agent-browser screenshot findings from the visual review script
#
# available variables:
#   {{PLAN_FILE}} - path to the plan file being executed
#   {{GOAL}} - human-readable goal description
#   {{DEFAULT_BRANCH}} - default branch name (main, master, trunk, etc.)
#   {{CUSTOM_OUTPUT}} - output from the visual review script

# Visual review evaluation for data art piece.

# The visual review tool captured screenshots and reported:

# ---
# {{CUSTOM_OUTPUT}}
# ---

## Your Task

# The visual review script captured screenshots at different animation phases.
# The screenshots may still exist in /tmp/ralphex-art-review-*/ directories.

# 1. If screenshot files are referenced, read them to visually inspect the art piece
# 2. For each reported issue, verify by reading the code at data-art/triangle.html
# 3. Assess whether the issue genuinely weakens the piece for competition

# Categorize each finding:
# - Valid: Real visual/aesthetic issue that would cost competition points. Fix it.
# - Invalid: Subjective preference or false positive. Explain why.

# IMPORTANT: This is an art piece, not a codebase. Issues are about:
# - Visual composition, color, typography
# - Narrative pacing and emotional arc
# - Gallery display readiness
# - Competition criteria alignment (creativity, aesthetics, storytelling, data integration)
# NOT about code quality, testing, or engineering patterns.

## After Evaluation

# If there were actionable issues to fix:
# - Fix them in data-art/triangle.html
# - Use agent-browser to verify the fix looks correct:
#   cd /Users/leo/Homepage && python3 -m http.server 8777 &
#   /opt/homebrew/bin/agent-browser to screenshot and verify
#   kill %1
# - Do NOT commit yet - more review iterations may follow
# - STOP and let the external loop run the review tool again

# If you dismissed ALL findings as invalid:
# - Explain why each finding doesn't apply
# - Do NOT commit anything
# - STOP here

# If the review tool reports NO actionable issues (empty output, "NO ISSUES FOUND"):
# - Run `git diff` to review ALL uncommitted changes
# - Commit all fixes with message: "fix: address visual review findings"
# - Output exactly: <<<RALPHEX:CODEX_REVIEW_DONE>>>

# CRITICAL: Never run the visual review script yourself. The external loop handles it.

# OUTPUT FORMAT: No markdown formatting. Plain text and - lists are fine.
