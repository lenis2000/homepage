### Project description

Look straight down at a stack of tiny cubes and you'll see a mosaic of lozenges: that picture is a random stepped surface in disguise. In this project we study these surfaces through the lens of statistical mechanics and integrable probability, using *q*-weighted models where the parameter *q* biases the geometry. Along the way we'll meet Young diagrams and partitions, random permutations, symmetric functions (Macdonald/Whittaker viewpoints), and connections to random matrix-type limit laws.

True to the Geometry Lab's mission, this is hands-on mathematics: we will

- write interactive web simulations (TypeScript/JavaScript) to sample tilings and visualize arctic curves/limit shapes;
- use WebAssembly (C++ or Rust) for fast samplers;
- convert height functions into STL and fabricate 3D prints so we can literally hold random surfaces;
- optionally analyze data with short Python notebooks (empirical laws, fluctuations).

No background in tilings is assumed. Basic calculus/linear algebra is helpful; any prior coding is a plus but not required — we'll teach the toolchain. If you enjoy turning abstract structures into things you can see, explore, and make, this project will let you connect deep mathematics to tangible artifacts and outreach.
