<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    This course will explore a rich zoo of probabilistic models, with a focus on
    random matrices, dimer models, and statistical mechanical models of
    algebraic origin. Geometric structures that naturally arise in these
    contexts will also be discussed. The course content will be flexible and
    tailored to the interests of participants, making it ideal for most graduate
    students in the math department, second year and up.
</p>

<p class="mb-2">
    A key feature of the course will be a "reading course" component, where
    weekly meetings provide focused, interactive learning sessions.
</p>

<p class="mb-2">
    Some topics will repeat from the continuous probability-heavy course
    <a href="https://lpetrov.cc/rmt19/">https://lpetrov.cc/rmt19/</a> but most
    of the content will be new.
</p>

</ol>

<h4>Weekly individual meetings</h4>

<p>
    The course spans 12 full weeks, excluding the first week, final week, and the week following Spring break when I will be traveling. Students are required to meet with me at least 8 times during these 12 weeks, with each meeting lasting approximately 45 minutes. These meetings are an integral part of the reading course, during which we can discuss lectures, homework problem solutions, presentation, explore research topics, or dig into any other relevant topics related to random matrices.
</p>

<p class="mb-2" />
During the first week of class, we will establish a regular weekly meeting time for each student. While some flexibility is possible, the goal is to maintain a consistent weekly schedule throughout the semester.</p>

        <h2>Assessment <span>&#9660;</span></h2>
    </summary>
    <p>The course grade is based roughly equally on three components:</p>

    <h4>1. Homework Problems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Problems are included and mentioned in lectures, posted separately as weekly problem sets</li>
        <li>Each problem has a deadline of a month or until the course ends</li>
        <li>
            Problems range from easy to very difficult, not all problems need to
            be solved
        </li>
        <li>Submit problems by email, or communicate orally during meetings</li>
        <li>It is expected that you need to solve about 2 problems in each problem set</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Presentation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each student gives one presentation (30 min) during April Monday sessions
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Weekly Meetings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Participation in 8 individual meetings required, see "Course Meetings" section above</li>
    </ul>
