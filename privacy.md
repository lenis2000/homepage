<h1 class="mb-3">Privacy information</h1>

This is a static personal website.
I do not explicitly collect any user information.

I use [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) cookies
to track website statistics.
You can turn off cookies in your browser
or block Google Analytics
to disable this tracking.

On pages with comments I use [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) javascript which sets some cookies, too.
You can turn off cookies in your browser
or block Disqus

Well, and the [cookie informer banner](https://github.com/dobarkod/cookie-banner/)
also sets cookies so that you see it only once.
