In the Spring 2017 me and [Axel Saenz](http://faculty.virginia.edu/saenz/) will continue with the Integrable Probability Reading Seminar. This time the topic will be "From random tilings to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality." In terms of content, this is not a continuation of the Fall’s seminar. In the Spring, the seminar’s aim is to give a user-friendly introduction to modern and rapidly developing topics in probability theory with connections to combinatorics, algebra, representation theory on one side, and statistical physics and many other applications on the other side.

<p>Material covered in this seminar is based on the surveys <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1596">arxiv.org/abs/1106.1596</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3351">arxiv.org/abs/1212.3351</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.8007">arxiv.org/abs/1310.8007</a>, and other recent works discussing additional topics and details. The format of the seminar will have presentations by participants interlaced with occasional talks by me and Axel Saenz, depending on the level of participants’ activity. We are also open to having outside speakers if they’re in town.</p>
