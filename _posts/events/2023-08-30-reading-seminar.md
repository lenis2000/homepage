<div><a href="{{site.url}}/reading-2023/">Reading seminar on solvable lattice models</a> in Fall 2023</div>
<!--more-->

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Tuesdays, 11:00am - 12:10pm, Kerchof 111</h2>

Solvable lattice models originated in mathematical physics (Ising model, square ice). They found numerous applications to combinatorics (enumerative and algebraic - keywords are nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials and Hecke algebras), representation theory (keyword - quantum groups), and more recently, probability. We will start with classical results, such as the Izergin-Korepin determinant and the entropy of the square ice. We'll select further topics based on the audience's interests.
