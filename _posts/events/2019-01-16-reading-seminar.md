<div><a href="{{site.url}}/reading-2019/">Reading seminar on integrable probability</a> in Spring 2019</div>
<!--more-->

<h2 class="mt-4 mb-3"> Fridays, 11:00am - 12:30pm, Kerchof 128</h2>

We will discuss the classical problem of describing analogues of irreducible representations of the infinite-dimensional unitary group (Edrei-Voiculescu theorem), and its connections with 
- representations of finite-dimensional unitary groups
- symmetric functions
- random lozenge tilings and asymptotic combinatorics
- total positivity 
- classical analysis (e.g. B-splines)
- von Neumann factor and spherical representations of the infinite-dimensional unitary group
- random matrices
