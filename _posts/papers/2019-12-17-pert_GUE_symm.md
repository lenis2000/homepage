The perturbed GUE corners ensemble is the joint distribution of eigenvalues of all principal submatrices of a matrix $G+\mathrm{diag}(\mathbf{a})$, where $G$ is the random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE), and $\mathrm{diag}(\mathbf{a})$ is a fixed diagonal matrix. We introduce Markov transitions based on exponential jumps of eigenvalues, and show that their successive application is equivalent in distribution to a deterministic shift of the matrix. This result also leads to a new distributional symmetry for a family of reflected Brownian motions with drifts coming from an arithmetic progression.

The construction we present may be viewed as a random matrix analogue of the [recent results]({{site.url}}/2019/07/backwards_TASEP/) of the first author and Axel Saenz.
