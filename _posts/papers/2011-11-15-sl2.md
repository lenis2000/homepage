We present a unified approach to various examples of Markov dynamics on
partitions studied by Borodin, Olshanski, Fulman, and the author. Our technique
generalizes the Kerov's operators first appeared in [Okounkov,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0002135">arXiv:math/0002135</a>], and also stems from the study of duality of graded graphs
in [Fomin, 1994].<!--more-->

Our main object is a countable branching graph carrying an $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{C})$-module of
a special kind. Using this structure, we introduce distinguished probability
measures on the floors of the graph, and define two related types of Markov
dynamics associated with these measures. We study spectral properties of the
dynamics, and our main result is the explicit description of eigenfunctions of
the Markov generator of one of the processes.

For the Young graph our approach reconstructs the z-measures on partitions
and the associated dynamics studied by Borodin and Olshanski
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0409075">arXiv:math-ph/0409075</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1034">arXiv:0706.1034</a>]. The generator of the dynamics of
[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0409075">arXiv:math-ph/0409075</a>] is diagonal in the basis of the Meixner symmetric
functions introduced recently by Olshanski [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2037">arXiv:1009.2037</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5848">arXiv:1103.5848</a>].
We give new proofs to some of the results of these two papers. Other graphs to
which our technique is applicable include the Pascal triangle, the Kingman
graph (with the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet measures), the Schur graph and
the general Young graph with Jack edge multiplicities.
