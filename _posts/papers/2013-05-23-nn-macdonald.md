Macdonald processes are certain probability measures on two-dimensional
arrays of interlacing particles introduced by Borodin and Corwin
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4408">arXiv:1111.4408</a> [math.PR]). They are defined in terms of nonnegative
specializations of the Macdonald symmetric functions and depend on two
parameters $(q,t)$, where $0\le q, t < 1$. Our main result is a classification of
continuous time, nearest neighbor Markov dynamics on the space of interlacing
arrays that act nicely on Macdonald processes.<!--more-->

The classification unites known examples of such dynamics and also yields
many new ones. When $t = 0$, one dynamics leads to a new integrable interacting
particle system on the one-dimensional lattice, which is a $q$-deformation of the
PushTASEP (= long-range TASEP). When $q = t$, the Macdonald processes become the
Schur processes of Okounkov and Reshetikhin (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0107056">arXiv:math/0107056</a> [math.CO]). In
this degeneration, we discover new Robinson--Schensted-type correspondences
between words and pairs of Young tableaux that govern some of our dynamics.
