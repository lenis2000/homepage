The z-measures on partitions originated from the problem of harmonic analysis of linear representations of the infinite symmetric group in the works of Kerov, Olshanski and Vershik (1993, 2004). A similar family corresponding to projective representations was introduced by Borodin (1997). The latter measures live on strict partitions (i.e., partitions with distinct parts), and the z-measures are supported by all partitions. In this note we describe some combinatorial relations between these two families of measures using the well-known doubling of shifted Young diagrams.
