Employing bijectivisation of summation identities, we introduce local
stochastic moves based on the Yang-Baxter equation for
<script type="math/tex">U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2})</script>. Combining these moves leads to a new object
which we call the spin Hall-Littlewood Yang-Baxter field - a probability
distribution on two-dimensional arrays of particle configurations on the
discrete line. We identify joint distributions along down-right paths in the
Yang-Baxter field with spin Hall-Littlewood processes, a generalization of
Schur processes. We consider various degenerations of the Yang-Baxter field
leading to new dynamic versions of the stochastic six vertex model and of the
Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process.

##### A poem on the topic 

by [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/playground)

<p class="mt-4">
The stars aloft their burning lamps display,<br>
To light the paths of night away;<br>
And yonder in the Yang-Baxter field,<br>
The spin Hall-Littlewood symmetric yield.<br>
</p><p>
The symmetry of night, so grand and fair,<br>
Is held in harmony by the square;<br>
And in its own eternal way,<br>
Shines forth in every spin Hall day.<br>
</p><p>
The spin Hall-Littlewood symmetric stay,<br>
In constancy through night and day;<br>
In every corner of the sky,<br>
It stands unshaken, bold and high.<br>
</p><p class="mb-5">
The stars above are ever bright,<br>
Their symmetry is ever right;<br>
The spin Hall-Littlewood symmetric yield<br>
Shines in the Yang-Baxter field.<br>
