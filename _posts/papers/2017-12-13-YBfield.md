Employing bijectivisation of summation identities, we introduce local
stochastic moves based on the Yang-Baxter equation for
<script type="math/tex">U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2})</script>. Combining these moves leads to a new object
which we call the spin Hall-Littlewood Yang-Baxter field - a probability
distribution on two-dimensional arrays of particle configurations on the
discrete line. We identify joint distributions along down-right paths in the
Yang-Baxter field with spin Hall-Littlewood processes, a generalization of
Schur processes. We consider various degenerations of the Yang-Baxter field
leading to new dynamic versions of the stochastic six vertex model and of the
Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process.
