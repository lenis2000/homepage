This is an erratum to the paper ["Stochastic higher spin vertex models on the line"]({{site.url}}/2015/02/stoch-higher/). The aim of the note is to address two separate
errors in the paper: finite vertical spin Plancherel identities, and a false duality claim. The other main statements of the paper (the definition of new stochastic particle systems,
duality relations for them, and contour integral observables)
are not affected.
