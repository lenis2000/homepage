We introduce a four-parameter family of interacting particle systems on the
line which can be diagonalized explicitly via a complete set of Bethe ansatz
eigenfunctions, and which enjoy certain Markov dualities.<!--more--> Using this, for the
systems started in step initial data we write down nested contour integral
formulas for moments and Fredholm determinant formulas for Laplace-type
transforms. Taking various choices or limits of parameters, this family
degenerates to many of the known exactly solvable models in the
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, as well as leads to many new examples
of such models. In particular, ASEP, the stochastic six-vertex model, $q$-TASEP
and various directed polymer models all arise in this manner. Our systems are
constructed from stochastic versions of the R-matrix related to the six-vertex
model. One of the key tools used here is the fusion of R-matrices and we
provide a probabilistic proof of this procedure.
