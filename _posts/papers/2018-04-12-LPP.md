We consider point-to-point directed paths in a random environment on the
two-dimensional integer lattice. For a general independent environment under
mild assumptions we show that the quenched energy of a typical path satisfies a
central limit theorem as the mesh of the lattice goes to zero. Our proofs rely
on concentration of measure techniques and some combinatorial bounds on
families of paths.
