<h1 class="mb-4 mt-4">Tools</h1>

I have developed several workflows around math which could be useful for others. I will describe them here. Here are some of the tools I use:

- [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) --- the famous software for symbolic computation
- [Alfred for Mac](https://www.alfredapp.com/) --- a launchpad for Mac which allows you to create custom workflows. A "workflow" is typically a command that has some text as an input, and which runs a terminal command. A reddit thread with [Windows analogues](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/5pek48/is_there_an_equivalent_for_windows_to_macs_alfred/). If you use linux, you probably have something like that, too.
- [heygpt](https://github.com/fuyufjh/heygpt) --- a simple command-line interface for ChatGPT API. I use ChatGPT via the [API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7039783-how-can-i-access-the-chatgpt-api), which allows me to pay about \$3/month instead of 20 for the web interface, and I can also pipelline it with other commands. This API only allows to use GPT-4 after your first bill; but for some of the tasks, GPT-3 is enough.
