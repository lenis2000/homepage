A colleague addressed a question to me and others, and after discussing how [arXiv](http://arxiv.org) orders submitted preprints we've concluded that the rules seem to be like this.

<!--more-->

It is well-known that
the deadline for submissions on a weekday
on the East Coast in the Winter is 4pm
(see [this page](http://arxiv.org/localtime)).
Then:

* if you submit right after the deadline (at 4:01pm), you end up being among the first on the general ["new preprints" list](http://arxiv.org/list/math/new).

* if you submit right before the deadline (at 3:59pm), you end up being among the first on the general ["recent" list](http://arxiv.org/list/math/recent), as well as on
the corresponding main subject list, e.g.,
[math.PR](http://arxiv.org/list/math.PR/recent).
On the subject lists,
cross-listed preprints go below.

So, you cannot be the first everywhere.

Update 2017: Since this entry the cutoff time was moved from 4pm to 2pm Eastern time. Also, better to submit on Thursday right before the deadline, so that the paper is up first for the whole weekend.
