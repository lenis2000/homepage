### Syllabus

The course is taught in the Fall 2019 semester at Department of Mathematics, University of Virginia

**Instructor.** Leonid Petrov. Contact information at [`{{site.url}}`]({{site.url}})

The class meets on TBA 

Office hours TBA

Office is Kerchof 209.

**Description.** Study of random matrices is an exciting topic with first major advances in the mid-20th century in connection with statistical (quantum) physics. Since then it found numerous connections to algebra, geometry, combinatorics, as well as to the core of the probability theory. The applications are also numerous: e.g., statistics, number theory, engineering, neuroscience; with more of them discovered every month. The course will discuss fundamental problems and results of Random Matrix Theory, and their connections to tools of algebra and combinatorics.

**Course homepage.** The course homepage is at [`{{site.url}}/rmt19/`]({{site.url}}/rmt19/). It contais
the syllabus, link to course notes, and other relevant information.

**Structure.** The course covers 5 main themes:

1. Limit shape results for random matrices (such as Wigner's Semicircle Law). Connections to Free Probability.
2. Concrete ensembles of random matrices (GUE, circular, and Beta ensembles). Bulk and edge asymptotics via exact computations. Connection to determinantal point processes.
3. Dyson's Brownian Motion and related stochastic calculus.
4. Universality of random matrix asymptotics.
5. (optional, depending on time available) Discrete analogues of random matrix models: random permutations, random tilings, interacting particle systems.

**References.** There are three main textbooks which will be used in the course. It is not required to buy any of them to successfully participate in the course.

2. Anderson, G.W., Guionnet, A. and Zeitouni, O. *"An Introduction to Random Matrices"*.
