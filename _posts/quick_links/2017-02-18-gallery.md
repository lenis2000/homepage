<div>Updated <a href="{{ site.url }}/simulations/">gallery of simulations</a> of integrable stochastic systems</div>

<!--more-->

There will be more simulations:
- raw data with well-described format; 
- links to source code of programs producing the data; 
- visualizations

and all this will be well-documented, so that I can upload any simulations I produce and record their parameters as the simulations are produced.

The only thing remaining is to invent a good layout for the head simulations page
