This special edition of the [Southeast Probability Conference](https://sites.duke.edu/sepc/) will focus on
interacting particle systems, random graphs, stochastic growth models, and
their applications in biology, ecology, and statistical physics.  It is also an
occasion to honor the contributions of [Professor Rick Durrett](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/)
on the occasion
of his 65th birthday.
