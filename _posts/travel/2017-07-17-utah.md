A three-week program which brought together numerous leading experts in random matrices and related
fields. For me personally this program has started a very exciting collaboration on probabilistic understanding of
combinatorial summation identities.

From the [program website](https://pcmi.ias.edu/program-index/2017):

<span class="highlighted-item">
Random matrix theory sits at the interface of many fields of mathematics such as probability, combinatorics, partial differential equations, algebraic geometry, and number theory. It also has many applications in physics (statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics), as well as practical applications in areas of computer science, statistics, and data science. This research program will bring together a diverse group of researchers united by their study and use of random matrix theory. This will naturally lead to exchanges in ideas and methods between different areas of science and mathematics, and will kickstart new interdisciplinary collaborations.
