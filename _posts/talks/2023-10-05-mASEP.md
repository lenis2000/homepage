Recently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting particle systems motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials). I will describe a unified approach to constructing stationary measures for colored ASEP, q-Boson, and q-PushTASEP systems based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang-Baxter equation. Stationary measures become partition functions of new "queue vertex models" on the cylinder, and stationarity is a direct consequence of the Yang-Baxter equation. Our construction recovers and generalizes known stationary measures constructed using multiline queues and the Matrix Product Ansatz. In the quadrant, Yang-Baxter implies a colored version of Burke's theorem, which produces stationary measures for particle systems on the line. We also compute the colored particle currents in stationarity. Joint work with Amol Aggarwal and Matthew Nicoletti.

Based on the [joint work with Amol Aggarwal and Matthew Nicoletti][ref44].
