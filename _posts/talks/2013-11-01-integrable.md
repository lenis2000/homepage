One of the versions of my "job talk" in Fall 2013 describing many facets of integrable
probability.
It is supposed to be accessible.
The talk is based on [[15]][ref15] and on the previous two talks.
More details can also be found in [arXiv:1106.1596 [math.PR]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1596) by Corwin and [arXiv:1212.3351 [math.PR]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3351) by Borodin and Gorin.
