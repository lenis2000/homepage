The talk is devoted to the construction of Markov dynamics
on interlacing arrays which act nicely on the Macdonald measures.
In a particular case one gets $q$-deformed Robinson-Schensted
insertion algorithms. The talk is based on 
[[12]][ref12], [[13]][ref13], see also 
[[14]][ref14], [[15]][ref15].
