Fibonacci words are words of 1's and 2's, graded by the total sum of the digits. They form a differential poset (YF) which is an estranged cousin of the Young lattice powering irreducible representations of the symmetric group. We introduce families of "coherent" measures on YF depending on many parameters, which come from the theory of clone Schur functions (Okada 1994). We characterize parameter sequences ensuring positivity of the measures, and we describe the large-scale behavior of some ensembles of random Fibonacci words. The subject has connections to total positivity of tridiagonal matrices, Stieltjes moment sequences, orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme, and residual allocation (stick-breaking) models.

Based on the [joint work with J. Scott][ref47].
