\begin{abstract}
	Fibonacci words are words of 1's and 2's, graded by the total sum of the digits. They form a differential poset ($\mathbb{YF}$) which is an estranged cousin of the Young lattice powering irreducible representations of the symmetric group. We introduce families of "coherent" measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ depending on many parameters, which come from the theory of clone Schur functions \cite{okada1994algebras}. We characterize parameter sequences ensuring positivity of the measures, and we describe the large-scale behavior of some ensembles of random Fibonacci words. The subject has connections to total positivity of tridiagonal matrices, Stieltjes moment sequences, orthogonal polynomials from the (q-)Askey scheme, and residual allocation (stick-breaking) models.

\section*{What is this text}

These are notes for a chalk talk, prepared based on the paper
\cite{PetrovScott2024Fibonacci}, in the ``extended lecture notes''
style, similar to my \href{https://lpetrov.cc/rmt25/}{random matrix course}.
Along the notes, there are numerous skipped details, 
which are left as exercises for the reader.

\section{Motivation 1. De Finetti's theorem and Pascal triangle}

\subsection{}

\begin{definition}
	A sequence $X_1,X_2,\ldots $
	of binary random variables
	(taking values in $\{0,1\}$)
	is called \emph{exchangeable}
	if for any $n$ and any permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ the joint distribution of $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ is the same as the joint distribution of $X_{\sigma(1)},X_{\sigma(2)},\ldots,X_{\sigma(n)}$.
\end{definition}

Exchangeable sequences are more than just Bernoulli iid sequences with some
parameter $p\in[0,1]$. Consider the Polya urn scheme.

Start with an urn containing $b$ black and $w$ white balls.
At each step, draw a ball uniformly at random from the urn
and put it back along with another ball of the same color.

The sequence of ball colors drawn from the urn is exchangeable.

At time $n$, there are $n$ new balls in the urn, and the distribution of the number of, say,
black balls,
\begin{equation*}
	\operatorname{\mathbb{P}}\left( \textnormal{black}=k \right) = M_n(k),
	\qquad k=0,1,\ldots,n,
\end{equation*}
is called the ($n$-th) \emph{coherent measure}.
We can talk about $S_n$, the random variable which is the number of black balls drawn by time $n$.
The coherent measures $M_n$ for various $n$ satisfy certain linear
recurrence relations.

One can convince oneself that the space of coherent measures is
the same as the space of exchangeable random sequences of 0's and 1's.
This space is a convex set, moreover, it is a simplex.

Extreme points of this simplex are given by iid sequences,
that is, Bernoulli product measures on $\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^\infty$.
This is de Finetti's theorem.

\subsection{}

Coherent measures on Pascal triangle are related to exchangeable
sequences of 0's and 1's. The \emph{boundary} of the Pascal
triangle encodes all possible coherent measures via the law of large numbers,
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{S_n}{n}\to \mu \quad \textnormal{on} \quad [0,1].
\end{equation*}
Extreme measures correspond to delta point masses.
For example, the Polya urn for $a=b=1$ corresponds to $\mu$ being the
uniform measure on $[0,1]$.

\subsection{Lonely paths}

There are two distinguished paths in the Pascal triangle, the
\emph{lonely paths} $0\to00\to000\to\ldots $
and
$1\to 11\to111\to\ldots $, which are characterized by the
property that \cite{KerovGoodman1997}
\begin{quote}
	All but finitely many vertices in the path have a single immediate predecessor.
\end{quote}
These paths correspond to the extreme measures
with $\mu=\delta_0$ and $\mu=\delta_1$, respectively.


\section{Motivation 2. Young lattice}

The Young lattice $\mathbb{Y}$ of integer partitions ordered
by the relation ``adding a box''
encodes another meaningful structure --- irreducible representations of the symmetric groups.
The boundary encodes the irreducible representations of the infinite symmetric group $S(\infty)$.

\subsection{}
The Young lattice is a \emph{differential poset} \cite{stanley1988differential},
\cite{fomin1994duality},
in the sense that
\begin{quote}
	for each $\lambda$, there is one more element in the set
	$\left\{ \nu\colon\nu=\lambda+\square \right\}$ than
	in the set $\left\{ \mu\colon\mu=\lambda-\square \right\}$.
\end{quote}
Differential poset
property implies that
for $f^\lambda$ the number of paths from $\varnothing$ to $\lambda$, we have
\begin{equation*}
	\sum_{|\lambda|=n}(f^\lambda)^2=n!, \qquad \textnormal{define}\qquad
	M_n(\lambda)\coloneqq\frac{(f^\lambda)^2}{n!}.
\end{equation*}
The measure $M_n$ is called \emph{Plancherel}, it is coherent
and extremal. It corresponds to the regular representation of $S(\infty)$,
which is irreducible.

\subsection{}

There are two lonely paths here, as well --- corresponding to growing
one-row and one-column partitions.

\subsection{}

All extreme coherent measures on the Young lattice are given by specializations
of Schur symmetric functions, and have the form
\begin{equation*}
	M_n(\lambda)=s_\lambda(\vec \alpha;\vec \beta;\gamma)\cdot f^\lambda.
\end{equation*}
The problem of describing the boundary of $\mathbb{Y}$ is equivalent to
the problem of finding parameters $\vec \alpha,\vec \beta,\gamma$ such that
the Schur functions $s_\lambda(\vec \alpha;\vec \beta;\gamma)$ are nonnegative
for all $\lambda$.

Schur functions are (essentially) determinants, and
for the Young lattice, we have a great match between these multiparameter functions and
extreme coherent measures.


\section{Another differential poset --- the Young--Fibonacci lattice}

\subsection{}

A natural question arises: do other differential posets exist?
Indeed, there exists another fundamental example, denoted $\mathbb{YF}$, which, upon first examination,
might seem contrived and unnatural.
(While there also 
exists a family of posets interpolating between
$\mathbb{YF}$ and $\mathbb{Y}$, we shall not explore that
here.)

\subsection{}

The Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$ 
can be formed starting from the single edge $\varnothing\to 1$,
by successive reflection. We then encode the new vertices as starting from $1$ (followed by the 
old vertex index from the level $n-1$), and the 
reflected vertices as starting from $2$ (followed by the
old vertex index from the level $n-2$).

\begin{figure}[htp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{YF}
\end{figure}

\subsection{}

$\mathbb{YF}$ is a graded poset formed
by Fibonacci words (binary words whose digits lie in
$\{1,2\}$), graded by the total sum of the digits.

We denote the set of all Fibonacci words of weight $n$ by
$\mathbb{YF}_n$. Clearly, the total number of such words is
the $n$th Fibonacci number (with $F_0 = F_1 = 1$). The poset
$\mathbb{YF}$ is then the disjoint union of all
$\mathbb{YF}_n$ for $n = 0,1,2,\ldots,$ with rank function
given by the weight $|w| = n$. We always identify the empty
word $\varnothing$ with $\mathbb{YF}_0$.


\begin{definition}[Young--Fibonacci Partial Order]
\label{def:YF-partial-order}
We say a Fibonacci word $w$ \emph{covers} another Fibonacci word $v$ if $|v| = |w| - 1$ and one can transform $w$ to $v$ by one of the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $w = 1 \,v$, then we delete the leftmost $1$ to obtain $v$.
\item If $w = 2 \,u$ for some $u$, then we obtain $v$ by turning the leftmost $2$ into a $1$ or by removing an inserted $1$ after a $2$ in some initial segment.
\end{enumerate}
In this situation we write $w \searrow v$ or equivalently $v \nearrow w$. Hence, for $w \in \mathbb{YF}_n$ and $v \in \mathbb{YF}_{n-1}$, we have $w \searrow v$ if and only if $v$ can be obtained from $w$ via exactly one of the above operations.
\end{definition}

\noindent
It is not difficult to check that these rules indeed give a partial order on the set of Fibonacci words. A concise (though somewhat recursive) way to view this order is:
\[
w \;\;=\;\;
\begin{cases}
1\,v, & \text{if the leftmost letter is } 1,
\\[4pt]
2\,u, & \text{if the leftmost letter is } 2,
\end{cases}
\quad
\text{where } u,v \text{ are shorter Fibonacci words;}
\]
one descends $w \searrow v$ by altering or removing part of the leftmost digit or its next neighbor. We encourage the reader to compare this with the usual rules of forming and dismantling integer partitions in the Young lattice. The resulting graded set is the Young--Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$.

Below is the Hasse diagram for $\mathbb{YF}$ up to rank $n=3$. Notice how each vertex $w \in \mathbb{YF}_n$ has $n$ distinct upward extensions in rank $n+1$, reflecting that $\mathbb{YF}$ is a $1$-differential poset (see Lecture~2 for the general definition of a differential poset):
\[
\xymatrixrowsep{0.40in}
\xymatrixcolsep{0.28in}
\xymatrix{
& \varnothing \ar@{-}[dl] \ar@{-}[dr] & \\
1 \ar@{-}[d] & & 2 \ar@{-}[d] \\
11 \ar@{-}[d] & & 12 \ar@{-}[dll] \ar@{-}[d] \\
111 & 21 & 112
}
\]
Each Fibonacci word $w$ of rank $n$ has a single downward step $\varnothing \searrow \ldots \searrow w$, along with a prescribed set of $n$ upward neighbors $w' \in \mathbb{YF}_{n+1}$. This will be crucial in our later constructions of Markov chains on $\mathbb{YF}$.

\subsection{Counting Paths and Dimension Formula}

One essential property of $\mathbb{YF}$ is that it is a \emph{$1$-differential poset}, just like the Young lattice. In particular, the total number of upward paths from $\varnothing$ to any $w \in \mathbb{YF}_n$ is given by the following closed form.

\begin{definition}[Dimension of a Fibonacci Word]
\label{def:dimension_of_word}
For $w \in \mathbb{YF}_n$ of the form
$w = a_1 \, a_2 \cdots a_\ell$ with each $a_j \in \{1,2\}$, let $\dim(w)$ denote the number of saturated chains $\varnothing = w_0 \nearrow w_1 \nearrow \cdots \nearrow w_n = w$. Specifically, define
\[
\dim(w)
\;=\;
\prod_{\substack{1 \,\leq\, j \,\leq\, \ell \\ a_j \,=\, 2}}
\bigl( |u_j| + 1 \bigr),
\]
where $u_j$ is the subword to the right of the $j$-th digit. Equivalently, if $w = 2^{k_1} 1 \;2^{k_2} 1 \cdots 1 \; 2^{k_r}$ for some $r$ (allowing some $k_j=0$ and possibly $k_r = 0$), then
\[
\dim(w) \;=\;\;
\prod_{j=1}^r \bigl(1 + \sum_{t=1}^j k_t \bigr).
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Dimension Formula]
\label{thm:dimension-formula}
The function $w \mapsto \dim(w)$ agrees with the number of upward paths from the minimal element $\varnothing$ to $w$ in the poset $\mathbb{YF}$. In particular, for $n \ge 1$,
\[
\sum_{w \,\in\, \mathbb{YF}_n} \dim^2(w)
\;=\;
n!.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The equality of $\dim(w)$ with the number of saturated chains from $\varnothing$ to $w$ follows by checking the local covering rules in Definition \ref{def:YF-partial-order}. Specifically, to create a new ``digit 2'' in any upward step, one has $1 + k$ ways if $k$ copies of 2 lie to the left. The $1$-differential property then enforces that each saturated chain collectively contributes the described product factor. The standard double-counting argument (as in the Young lattice case) then shows
\[
\sum_{w \,\in\, \mathbb{YF}_n} \dim^2(w)
\,=\,
\bigl(\boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}\boldsymbol{\mathcal{U}}\bigr)^n (\delta_\varnothing)(\varnothing)
\,=\,
n!,
\]
where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{U}}, \boldsymbol{\mathcal{D}}$ are the usual up/down operators on $\mathbb{YF}$ (see Lecture~2). This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
Fibonacci words thus manifest many characteristics parallel to integer partitions. However, as we will see, the Young--Fibonacci lattice displays new and subtler phenomena in its harmonic functions and representation theory. This richer behavior arises in part because each rank $n$ in $\mathbb{YF}$ has the Fibonacci number of elements, rather than the partition number $p(n)$. We now turn to how these enumerative features shape the structure of clone Schur functions and their associated probability measures.
\end{remark}
