<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p class="mb-2">
    This course will explore a rich zoo of probabilistic models, with a focus on
    random matrices, dimer models, and statistical mechanical models of
    algebraic origin. Geometric structures that naturally arise in these
    contexts will also be discussed. The course content will be flexible and
    tailored to the interests of participants, making it ideal for most graduate
    students in the math department, second year and up.
</p>

<p class="mb-2">
    A key feature of the course will be a "reading course" component, where
    weekly meetings provide focused, interactive learning sessions.
</p>

<p class="mb-2">
    Some topics will repeat from the continuous probability-heavy course
    <a href="https://lpetrov.cc/rmt19/">https://lpetrov.cc/rmt19/</a> but most
    of the content will be new.
</p>

<h4>Student Presentations on Mondays in April</h4>
<ol>
    <li><b>(Mon) April 7</b></li>
    <li><b>(Mon) April 14</b></li>
    <li><b>(Mon) April 21</b></li>
    <li><b>(Mon) April 28</b> (tentative - depending on number of enrolled students)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Weekly individual meetings</h4>

<p>
    The course spans 12 full weeks, excluding the first week, final week, and the week following Spring break when I will be traveling. Students are required to meet with me at least 8 times during these 12 weeks, with each meeting lasting approximately 45 minutes. (In-person is strongly preferred, but a zoom option is available.)
    These meetings are an integral part of the reading course, during which we can discuss lectures, homework problem solutions, presentation, explore research topics, or dig into any other relevant topics related to random matrices.
</p>

<p class="mb-2" />
During the first week of class, we will establish a regular weekly meeting time for each student. While some flexibility is possible, the goal is to maintain a consistent weekly schedule throughout the semester.</p>

    <summary>
        <h2>Assessment <span>&#9660;</span></h2>
    </summary>
    <p>The course grade is based roughly equally on three components:</p>

    <h4>1. Homework Problems</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Problems are included and mentioned in lectures, posted separately as weekly problem sets</li>
        <li>Each problem has a deadline of a month or until the course ends. Late assignments are not accepted. If you have special needs, emergency, or unavoidable conflicts, please let me know as soon as possible, so we can arrange a workaround.</li>
        <li>
            Problems range from easy to very difficult, not all problems need to
            be solved
        </li>
        <li>Submit problems by email, or communicate orally during meetings</li>
        <li>It is expected that you need to solve about 2 problems in each problem set</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Presentation</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each student gives one presentation (30 min) during April Monday sessions
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Weekly Meetings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Participation in 8 individual meetings required, see "Course Meetings" section above</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Policies <span>&#9660;</span></h2>
    </summary>

    <h4 class="mt-3">Approved accommodations</h4>

    All students with special needs requiring accommodations should present the
    appropriate paperwork from the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC). It is
    the student's responsibility to present this paperwork in a timely fashion and
    follow up with the instructor about the accommodations being offered.
    Accommodations for midterms or final exams (e.g., extended time) should be arranged at
    least 5 days before an exam.

    <h4 class="mt-3">Honor code</h4>

    The University of Virginia Honor Code applies to this
    class and is taken seriously.
    Any honor code violations
    will be referred to the
    Honor Committee.

    <h4 class="mt-3">Collaboration on homework assignments</h4>

    Group work on homework problems is allowed and strongly encouraged. Discussions are in general very helpful and inspiring. However, before talking to others, get well started on the problems, and contribute your fair share to the process. When completing the written homework assignments, everyone must write up his or her own solutions in their own words, and cite any reference (other than the textbook and class notes) that you use. Quotations and citations are part of the Honor Code for both UVA and the whole academic community.
