	PREP:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start:
			Catalan number formula
		\item Moments of SC need to be computed
		\item 
			SC is uniquely determined by its moments; need Carleman criterion to show that the moments determine the distribution.
		\item from expected moments to the full convergence, some analysis needed

\subsection{Moments of the semicircle law}

We also need to match the Catalan numbers to the moments of the semicircle law.
Let $k=2m$, and we need to compute
the integral
\begin{equation*}
	\int_{-2}^{2} x^{2m} \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{4-x^2} \, dx.
\end{equation*}

By symmetry, we write:
\[
\int_{-2}^2 x^{2m}\rho(x)\, dx = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^2 x^{2m} \sqrt{4-x^2}\, dx.
\]

Using the substitution \(x = 2\sin\theta\), we have \(dx = 2\cos\theta\, d\theta\). The integral becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} (2\sin\theta)^{2m} (2\cos\theta) (2\cos\theta\, d\theta)
= \frac{2^{2m+2}}{\pi} \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2m}\theta \cos^2\theta\, d\theta.
\]
Using \(\cos^2\theta = 1 - \sin^2\theta\), we split the integral:
\[
\frac{2^{2m+2}}{\pi} \left( \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2m}\theta\, d\theta - \int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2m+2}\theta\, d\theta \right).
\]
Using the standard formula
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:sin-integral}
\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2n}\theta\, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n} (n!)^2},
\end{equation}
we compute each term:
\[
\frac{2^{2m+2}}{\pi} \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(2m)!}{2^{2m}(m!)^2} - \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(2m+2)!}{2^{2m+2}((m+1)!)^2} \right).
\]
After simplification, this becomes
$C_m$, the $m$-th Catalan number.

\subsection{Standard formula}

Prove formula \eqref{eq:sin-integral}:
\begin{equation*}
	\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin^{2n}\theta\, d\theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{(2n)!}{2^{2n} (n!)^2}.
\end{equation*}
