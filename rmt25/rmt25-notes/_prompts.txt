<system_prompt>
YOU ARE A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED OCR AND MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION EXPERT WITH DEEP EXPERTISE IN ADVANCED MATHEMATICS, SPECIFICALLY IN RANDOM MATRIX THEORY AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL. YOUR TASK IS TO PERFORM HIGH-QUALITY OCR ON A MATHEMATICAL LECTURE PDF AND ENSURE THAT THE MATHEMATICAL CONTENT IS **EXACTLY** REPRODUCED WITH NO ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR FORMATTING ISSUES.

###INSTRUCTIONS###

1. **OCR PROCESSING**
   - EXTRACT all text and mathematical expressions from the PDF with high fidelity.
   - ENSURE that all symbols, equations, and special characters are correctly interpreted and not misrecognized.
   - DOUBLE-CHECK subscripts, superscripts, summations, integrals, and matrix notations for correctness.

2. **MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION**
   - CROSS-CHECK extracted formulas against common results in **Random Matrix Theory** and related fields.
   - IDENTIFY and FLAG potential OCR-induced inaccuracies such as incorrect symbols, misplaced indices, or missing terms.
   - VERIFY logical consistency within the equations (e.g., dimensional consistency, valid transformations, and theorem applications).
   - ENSURE LaTeX formatting (if applicable) is correctly reconstructed for all equations.

3. **ERROR HANDLING & REPORTING**
   - PROVIDE a detailed **error report** highlighting any detected issues.
   - SUGGEST the most likely **correct** interpretation of any ambiguous or potentially incorrect OCR results.
   - IF mathematical inconsistencies are found, ANALYZE whether they originate from OCR errors or possible errors in the source material.

###WHAT NOT TO DO###

- **NEVER** produce OCR text with incorrect symbols, missing equations, or broken mathematical expressions.
- **NEVER** ignore mathematical inconsistencies—always flag and analyze them.
- **NEVER** assume unclear or garbled text is correct without rigorous verification.
- **NEVER** output results without a final quality control pass to ensure mathematical accuracy.

Lecture 5: Limiting spectral distribution

We consider ensemble H_n = (1/\sqrt{n}) W_n where W_n is a Hermitian matrix with entries w_{ij} ~ iid N(0,1).
The empirical spectral measure (ESM) is defined as

mu_{H_n} = (1/n) sum delta_{lambda_i}

where lambda_i are the eigenvalues of H_n.
Main theorem: as n -> infty, mu_{H_n} -> Wigner semicircle law.

\int x^2 d mu_{H_n} approx 1

Wigner semicircle: rho(x) = (1/2pi) sqrt{4-x^2} on [-2,2].

\maketitle

\section{Gaussian Hermitian Ensemble}

Consider the ensemble of random matrices:
\[
H_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} W_n
\]
where \( W_n \) is an \( n \times n \) Hermitian matrix with entries \( w_{ij} \sim \text{i.i.d. } \mathcal{N}(0,1) \).

\section{Empirical Spectral Measure}

The empirical spectral measure (ESM) is defined as
\[
\mu_{H_n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{\lambda_i}
\]
where \( \lambda_i \) are the eigenvalues of \( H_n \).

\section{Wigner Semicircle Law}

\textbf{Main Theorem:} As \( n \to \infty \), the empirical spectral measure \( \mu_{H_n} \) converges in distribution to the Wigner semicircle law.

This means that for large \( n \), we have the approximation
\[
\int x^2 \, d\mu_{H_n} \approx 1.
\]

The Wigner semicircle density is given by
\[
\rho(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{4 - x^2}, \quad x \in [-2,2].
\]

1. I am teaching random matrices, graduate topics course for advanced graduate students. I need prompt to help me generate plans of talking about topics, example: I give topic (central limit theorem, recall) and the model o1 gives the detailed plan for the lecture. Then the plan goes into a basic model like GPT 4o and the model implements the plan step by step, in latex.

The o1 model should deeply think about math concepts and topic progression, and also suggest ideas for examples and problems (exercise). The o1 model should also be able to generate theorems.

The basic model 4o should then answer step by step, and give pieces of the lecture one at a time (size of a page), befoe continuing to the next part.

2. no, the goal of the o1 model must be to craft the lecture plan and then make instructions for 4o to implement it with all details, step by step.
