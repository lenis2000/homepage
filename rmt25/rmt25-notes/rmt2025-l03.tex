\section{Recap}

We have established the semicircle law for
real Wigner random matrices.
If $W$ is an $n\times n$ real symmetric matrix with
independent entries $X_{ij}$ above the main diagonal
(mean zero, variance $1$), and mean zero diagonal entries,
then the empirical spectral distribution of $W/\sqrt{n}$
converges to the semicircle law as $n\to\infty$:
\begin{equation*}
	\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \delta_{\lambda_i/\sqrt n} =
	\mu_{\mathrm{sc}}.
\end{equation*}
The convergence is weakly almost sure.
